DAY 1 – DATA ENGINEERING & ROAS CALCULATION

Problem:
Marketing data is available at a daily level, while orders data is transactional.
There is no direct campaign ID to link orders with marketing spend.

Granularity Mismatch:
Orders table contains thousands of rows per day.
Marketing table contains one row per day per channel.
Direct join is not possible without aggregation.

Solution:
1. Aggregated orders data to daily revenue using DATE(order_date).
2. Aggregated marketing data to daily spend.
3. Joined both datasets on date using LEFT JOIN.
4. Calculated ROAS = Total Revenue / Total Spend.

Why LEFT JOIN:
Marketing spend can exist even if no orders are placed on that day.

Edge Cases Handled:
- Zero revenue days → revenue set to 0 using COALESCE.
- Zero spend days → ROAS set to NULL to avoid misleading infinite values.

Business Meaning:
ROAS helps identify profitable vs loss-making marketing days and supports campaign optimization.
