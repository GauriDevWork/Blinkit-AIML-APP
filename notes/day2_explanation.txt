DAY 2 – DATA VISUALIZATION & BUSINESS INSIGHTS (STREAMLIT)

Objective:
To transform the SQL-based ROAS dataset into an interactive dashboard that allows
business managers to quickly understand marketing performance.

Data Source:
The dashboard consumes the Master ROAS dataset generated in PostgreSQL by joining
daily marketing spend with aggregated daily revenue.

Key Features Implemented:
1. Date Filter:
   - Allows users to select a custom date range.
   - Enables focused analysis for specific campaigns or periods.

2. KPI Cards:
   - Total Revenue: Shows revenue generated in the selected period.
   - Total Marketing Spend: Shows total ad spend.
   - Average ROAS: Indicates overall campaign efficiency.

3. Dual-Axis Visualization:
   - Bar Chart (Right Axis): Marketing Spend.
   - Line Chart (Left Axis): Revenue.
   - Helps visually detect cases where spend increases but revenue does not.

4. ROAS Interpretation:
   - Automatically flags inefficient marketing periods when ROAS < 1.
   - Provides instant business insight without manual analysis.

5. Low-ROAS Diagnostic Table:
   - Displays individual days where ROAS < 1.
   - Helps managers identify loss-making days for corrective action.

Business Value:
The dashboard enables non-technical stakeholders to:
- Monitor campaign effectiveness in real time.
- Identify underperforming marketing spend.
- Make data-driven decisions without querying databases.

Design Choices:
- SQL is used for data aggregation to maintain a single source of truth.
- Streamlit is used only for visualization and interaction.
- Logic is kept modular and readable for maintainability.

Outcome:
Day 2 successfully converts historical data into actionable insights,
bridging the gap between raw analytics and business decision-making.
