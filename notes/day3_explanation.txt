DAY 3 – MACHINE LEARNING (DELIVERY DELAY PREDICTION)

Objective:
To predict whether an order will be delivered late and provide a risk signal
to operations teams before fulfillment.

Problem Formulation:
The problem is framed as a binary classification task:
- 1 → Order is Late (actual_time > promised_time)
- 0 → Order is On-Time (actual_time <= promised_time)

Feature Engineering:
Since region and traffic data were not available, time-based features were used:
- hour_of_day: Captures peak vs non-peak delivery hours
- day_of_week: Captures weekday vs weekend patterns

Model Choice:
Logistic Regression was selected as a baseline model because:
- It is interpretable
- It outputs probabilities suitable for risk assessment
- It performs well with small feature sets

Model Evaluation:
- AUC (Area Under ROC Curve) was used as the evaluation metric
- The AUC score was relatively low, indicating limited predictive signal
- This is expected due to missing operational features such as region,
  rider availability, and traffic conditions

Deployment:
The trained model was saved as a .pkl file and integrated into the Streamlit
application as a Delivery Delay Risk Calculator.

Business Value:
The model provides a probabilistic risk score that helps operations teams
anticipate delays and take preventive action.
