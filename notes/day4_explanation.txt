DAY 4 – GENERATIVE AI (RAG-BASED BUSINESS ASSISTANT)

Objective:
To enable business users to understand customer sentiment and complaints
using natural language questions.

Approach:
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline was implemented using
real customer feedback data.

Retrieval:
- Customer feedback text is converted into embeddings using
  sentence-transformers
- Cosine similarity is used to retrieve the most relevant feedback
  for a user’s question

Generation:
- Retrieved feedback is passed as context to a Groq-hosted LLM
- The LLM generates grounded insights based only on the retrieved feedback

Why RAG:
- Prevents hallucination
- Ensures answers are grounded in real customer feedback
- Improves trust and explainability of AI responses

Technology Choice:
- Groq API was used as allowed by the project guidelines
- Local embeddings were used to reduce cost and improve performance

Outcome:
Business users can ask questions such as:
"Why are customers unhappy about delivery?"
and receive concise, explainable insights supported by actual feedback data.

Business Value:
The AI assistant helps identify root causes of dissatisfaction and supports
data-driven improvements to customer experience.
